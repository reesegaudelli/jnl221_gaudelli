<h3> Public art is on the rise. </h3>
<p> The Syracuse Public Arts Commission compiled a dataset that contains a list of public art that is on city owned property in Syracuse. Findings show that the amount of public art in downtown Syracuse has increased throughout the past few years. While there are a total of 80 murals in the entire city, most of the murals have been erected in recent years. 
 
<br> 
<br>

In 2022, eight new murals were added to the city, a huge increase since 2021, when only two murals were erected during that year. Three out of the eight new murals are a result of the
<a href="http://www.tomorrowsneighborhoodstoday.org/about-2" > "City as Canvas"</a> initiative. This project is run by Tomorrow's Neighborhood's Today (TNT), a non-profit organization that works to revitalize the Syracuse Community. Through funding from the American Rescue Plan Act, TNT was able to create this initiative with hopes of boosting the economy, beautifying areas of the city, and getting neighborhoods involved in civic pride projects post Covid-19. 

			</p>

			<h3>How the project works</h3>
			<p>The new murals will be erected in eight different sectors of the city. In each of these sectors, the entire community gets to take part in the project. The artists submit and present their work, while the community members get to vote on which art piece they want to be erected. This project is meant to be accessible for everyone in the community, which is why the voting is done on a postcard. Many Syracuse residents live in internet deserts, where they wouldn’t have access to online voting. Though the post card is less efficient, it is important to members of TNT that every single person feels that they have a role in this project. 
 Art administrator for “City as Canvas”, Karen Greenfield explains how this project is stimulating economic growth for the whole community.

“We are going to be able to employ eight artists, not to mention me and other people that were hired to work on this project. We are also funding the community and buying from local paint companies and print companies.The project is meant to involve everyone in these neighborhoods, ” said Greenfield. 
 
<br> 
<br>
So far, three murals have been erected in Eastwood, Westside, and Downtown Syracuse. As of right now, there are 18 total murals in downtown Syracuse out of a total of 45.

			<h3> Employing and inspiring local artists</h3>
			<p>Greenfield is excited to see that local artists are responsive to this project, even though it is challenging to be chosen to paint one of the murals. Artists have to apply, present their work, and then get voted on by the community. Despite these challenges, Greenfield explained how the turnout of artists has been remarkable. So far, they’ve had at least eight submissions for each mural. 

<br>
<br>

This project is inspiring artists to submit their work, even though many of them have never painted murals before. Artist Cecily Thomas who painted a mural Downtown titled “This Must Be The Place” is a tattoo artist. This was her first time ever painting a 90 foot mural. Because of this project, artists are getting the opportunity to work and make money, something that is rare for them.  
<br>
<br>

In an <a href="http://www.tomorrowsneighborhoodstoday.org/about-2"> interview for TNT </a> artist Cayetano Valenzuela, one of the first artists to create a mural for “City as Canvas”, felt emotional as they unveiled his mural “And Still I Rise” based on a poem by Maya Angelou. 

<br> 
<br>
“I was overwhelmed with a sense of gratitude for the community that entrusted me to do this. Especially the people that came by that let me know that they hear me and that they’re responding because I’m responding to the community,” Valenzuela said.

<h3> Promoting civic pride </h3>
			<p>The purpose of “City as Canvas” is to revamp the city and create a community that people are proud of. The theme of these murals is “Civic Pride”. When people think of civic pride, many think of Syracuse University or Otto the Orange. However, Greenfield explained how she wanted these pieces of art to be more about the city itself. 
		<br>
		<br>


“I’ve been trying to explain to people that civic pride is more than just the city you live in, it’s about the people. Being proud of where you live can mean walking down the street and saying ‘that’s cool, I like that I live here,” said Greenfield.

<br>
<br>

Though public art may not fix infrastructure or the paving of roads, it is healing and engaging the community. 

<br>

“Not everybody loves public art, not everybody loves murals, and not everybody places a high importance on it, but man those artists and their families are gonna appreciate it. The people in the community that walk by and see something beautiful painted on the building, that’s a cool thing,” said Greenfield.
