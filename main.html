<h1> Anxious Times Descend on New York. Enter Springsteen.</h1>
<h2> There was tension in the city as New Yorkers waited for Donald J. Trump to appear, but in the meantime, Bruce kept playing at the Garden.</h2>
<p> <strong> By Michael Wilson </strong> </p>

<p> “I don’t wanna go home,” Bruce Springsteen told some 20,000 cheering fans on Saturday night in Madison Square Garden. “New York, wanna go home?”
<br> 
<br> 
An age-old showman’s shtick, sure, recalling when James Brown feigned being dragged offstage by bandmates fearful for his health — a gag Mr. Springsteen himself, now 73, has toyed with over the years.

<br> 
<br> 
But on this night, in this city, during this week, the question perhaps carried a greater weight. Home, for New Yorkers, is a complicated and unsettling place these days.

<br> 
<br> 

On Tuesday, three miles away downtown, a former president of the United States is expected to surrender and face charges in the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building, a scene without precedent. The arrival of Donald J. Trump in the heavily Democratic city he long called home promises to be met with fervent protests and counter-protests.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican U.S. representative from Georgia, has <a href="https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1641793406539030528
/" target="_blank">promised on Twitter </a>  to come to New York to protest the “WITCH HUNT” and urged her 667,000 followers to join her.

<br> 
<br> 

The man himself has warned of “potential death and destruction” on Truth Social, his social media platform.

<br> 
<br> 


This specific drama has, for now, overshadowed the lingering fallouts of the pandemic and other issues in New York City, with increased wariness of crime, the stubborn persistence of vacant office buildings, an influx of migrants shipped from the southern border, and — well, you name it, any economic or social or cultural crisis, and we’ve got it, right here.
<br> 
<br> 


So, no, Bruce, we do not want to go home. Keep playing.
<br> 
<br> 

Like many in the house, Mr. Springsteen too was at home on Saturday, just across the river from his bed in his native New Jersey after two months of barnstorming the country on his first U.S. tour with the E Street Band since 2016. With all respect to those cities where he has recently performed, beginning in Tampa and heading west, for New Yorkers, a Springsteen tour only really begins when it arrives at that legendary address on Seventh Avenue in Midtown.
<br> 
<br> 
“It’s a Garden party,” said Maggie McManus, 60, from Astoria, Queens, sitting in a nearby Irish bar with her sister, Rory Brown, 61, before the show, their latest in a series dating back to the 1980s when the Boss wore a bandanna on his head.
<br> 
<br> 


“When he’s in New York, that’s when the show explodes,” Ms. Brown said.
<br> 
<br> 

“Like seeing Pearl Jam in Seattle — he’s home,” her sister added.
<br>
<br> 

Mr. Springsteen’s first outing in the Garden was not met fondly when he opened for the band Chicago in 1973, a perhaps odd pairing that did him no favors. But the critics were soon on board — “Mr. Springsteen has evolved into one of the most exciting young figures in rock music,” The New York Times declared in 1974 — and in 1978, his three-night return to the arena, behind the album “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” was a triumph.
<br> 
<br>
Headlining the first August night of that run was “the most important night of my life,” he told <a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvYy9GZCfUs
/" target="_blank">Eyewitness News </a> afterward. Then 28, he seemed to falter for words: “It was, like, real special. Crowd was great. Kids were, like, they were great, you know? It was good.”
